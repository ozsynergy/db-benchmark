Final benchmark results across all databases (100 requests per query type):

__MongoDB:__

- Keyword Text Search: 1.63 ms
- Lookup by Identifier: 0.80 ms
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 0.54 ms
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 1.43 ms

__MySQL:__

- Keyword Text Search: 0.91 ms
- Lookup by Identifier: 0.32 ms
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 0.37 ms
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 0.66 ms

__Elasticsearch:__

- Keyword Text Search: 5.09 ms
- Lookup by Identifier: 3.83 ms
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 2.66 ms
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 3.04 ms

Results show MySQL generally fastest, followed by MongoDB, with Elasticsearch slowest overall. Keyword text search is slowest for all databases.

Benchmark results with larger dataset (10k users, 1k courses, 20k enrollments, 50 requests per query type):

__MongoDB:__

- Keyword Text Search: 8.67 ms
- Lookup by Identifier: 0.55 ms
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 0.60 ms
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 6.77 ms

__MySQL:__

- Keyword Text Search: 3.33 ms
- Lookup by Identifier: 0.29 ms
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 0.43 ms
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 3.32 ms

__Elasticsearch:__

- Keyword Text Search: 3.25 ms
- Lookup by Identifier: 3.73 ms
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 1.93 ms
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 2.69 ms

__Performance Comparison:__

- MySQL consistently fastest across most query types
- Elasticsearch strong in keyword search and aggregation, but slower on exact lookups
- MongoDB competitive in lookups, but lag in text search and aggregation with larger data
- Overall: MySQL ≈ Elasticsearch > MongoDB with this dataset size and query patterns
