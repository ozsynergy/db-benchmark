- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 12.99 ms

__Elasticsearch:__

- Keyword Text Search: 5.38 ms
- Lookup by Identifier: 4.35 ms
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 2.66 ms
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 3.33 ms

__Performance Comparison with Largest Dataset:__

- PostgreSQL and MySQL excel in exact lookups and multi-factor queries
- Elasticsearch performs well in keyword search and aggregations
- MongoDB shows strength in exact lookups but struggles with text search and aggregations
- PostgreSQL slightly edges out MySQL in most categories with this large dataset
- Overall ranking: PostgreSQL ≈ MySQL > Elasticsearch > MongoDB

FULL MOVIE DATASET BENCHMARK RESULTS (45,571 movies - 45,000+ courses)
Dataset: 20,000 users, 45,000+ courses (real movie data), 450,000+ enrollments
Test: 5 requests per query type

__MySQL - Full Dataset:__

- Keyword Text Search: 10.94 ms (5x slower than 2k dataset)
- Lookup by Identifier: 0.74 ms (minimal impact)
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 1.79 ms (3x slower)
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 70.66 ms (10x slower - biggest impact)

__PostgreSQL - Full Dataset:__

- Keyword Text Search: 5.46 ms (faster than 2k dataset!)
- Lookup by Identifier: 0.59 ms (faster)
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 1.01 ms (minimal impact)
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 67.29 ms (11x slower - biggest impact)

__MongoDB - Full Dataset:__

- Keyword Text Search: 12.96 ms (6x slower)
- Lookup by Identifier: 1.03 ms (minimal impact)
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 2.75 ms (3x slower)
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 193.53 ms (15x slower - worst degradation)

__Elasticsearch - Full Dataset:__

- Keyword Text Search: 25.09 ms (minimal impact)
- Lookup by Identifier: 22.04 ms (2x slower)
- Lookup by Multiple Factors: 10.34 ms (2x slower)
- Aggregation Top 5 Courses: 25.51 ms (2x slower - most consistent)

__Full Dataset Performance Analysis:__

- Dataset Scale: 22.5x larger than previous largest test (45k vs 2k courses)
- Aggregation queries suffer most (10-15x performance degradation)
- PostgreSQL text search actually improves with GIN indexes at scale
- Elasticsearch scales most gracefully (only 2x degradation)
- MongoDB shows worst scaling characteristics, especially for aggregations
- Simple lookups remain fast across all databases regardless of size

__Final Rankings by Query Type (Full Dataset):__

*Text Search:* PostgreSQL > MongoDB > MySQL > Elasticsearch
*Exact Lookups:* PostgreSQL ≈ MySQL > MongoDB > Elasticsearch
*Multi-Factor:* PostgreSQL > MySQL > Elasticsearch > MongoDB
*Aggregation:* Elasticsearch > PostgreSQL > MySQL > MongoDB

__Scaling Conclusions:__
- Small datasets (<10k records): All databases perform similarly
- Large datasets (>100k records): Database choice depends on query patterns
- Text-heavy workloads: PostgreSQL with GIN indexes scales exceptionally well
- Analytics workloads: Elasticsearch maintains performance best at scale
- Simple CRUD operations: Any database works with minimal performance differences
